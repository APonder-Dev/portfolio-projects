# 🔐 Cybersecurity & Software Development Portfolio

This document provides a deeper look at the projects I’ve completed for my **Cybersecurity & Networking** and **Software Development** studies at Southwestern Illinois College (SWIC).  
Each project is documented with its **objective, tools, process, and results** to demonstrate applied skills.

## 🐍 Python Security Automation Toolkit
- **Objective:** Automate detection of failed SSH login attempts, block suspicious IPs, and export results into CSV/JSON.  
- **Tools & Skills:** Python 3, Regex, Linux (UFW/iptables), CSV/JSON handling.  
- **Process:**  
  1. Parsed `auth.log` files for failed login attempts.  
  2. Identified IPs with multiple failures.  
  3. Automated IP blocking with UFW/iptables.  
  4. Exported findings into machine-readable formats.  
- **Results:** Produced working scripts that can be tested with sample log files.  
- **Repo Link:** [py-sec-tools](../cybersecurity/py-sec-tools)

## 🔥 Firewall Configuration Simulator
- **Objective:** Build an interactive simulator where users test firewall rules and packet flow outcomes.  
- **Tools & Skills:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP (or Python Flask).  
- **Process:** Designed a web app where packets are evaluated against firewall rules.  
- **Results:** Educational tool to visualize rule order and packet filtering.  
- **Repo Link:** (coming soon)

## 🕵️ Penetration Testing Lab
- **Objective:** Simulate a penetration test in a controlled environment.  
- **Tools & Skills:** Kali Linux, Nmap, Metasploit, DVWA/Metasploitable VM.  
- **Process:** Ran scans, identified vulnerabilities, attempted exploits, and wrote a pen test report.  
- **Results:** Demonstrated ability to conduct ethical hacking workflows and recommend mitigations.  
- **Repo Link:** (coming soon)

## ⚖️ Risk Management Plan
- **Objective:** Create a risk assessment plan for a mock organization using NIST standards.  
- **Tools & Skills:** NIST SP 800-30, risk matrix, documentation.  
- **Process:** Identified critical assets, mapped threats/vulnerabilities, rated risk levels, and proposed mitigations.  
- **Results:** Produced a professional risk management document.  
- **Repo Link:** (coming soon)

## 🌐 Secure Network Architecture
- **Objective:** Design a secure enterprise network topology with segmentation and access control.  
- **Tools & Skills:** Cisco Packet Tracer, VLANs, ACLs, routing.  
- **Process:** Created a topology, configured routers/switches, and tested ACLs.  
- **Results:** Demonstrated ability to design and secure a network environment.  
- **Repo Link:** (coming soon)
